# Library-Database-Management-System
This is a Library Database Management System Project.
This is coded entirely in Python.
The Frontend is developed with tkinter a Python GUI package.
The Backend used here is Oracle 11g, hence the functions of updating, adding and deleting is confined to System installed with Oracle 11g.
This is my 1st Project so pardon the ineffective coding.

1)  tkinter (Pyhton GUI package)
2)  numpy (General purpose array-processing Python package)
